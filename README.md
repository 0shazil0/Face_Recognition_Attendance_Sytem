<h2 align="center"> Effortlessly track Employee attendance with a reliable Face Recognition System. </h2>

## Description

 This is a Face Recognition Attendance System with Firebase as a Database,Flask as backend OpenCV and Face Recognition modules for developing a face recognition model, with a goal to track employees attendnce effortlessly.

 #### Tech Stack:
 - Python
 - OpenCV
 - Firebase
 - Flask
 - HTML, CSS



## Getting Started

- Start by cloning the repository into your local machine. Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/0shazil0/cv-attendance-system.git
```

- Next, install all the necessary modules and dependencies listed in the requirement.txt file. Keep in mind that some modules might be missing, which could result in an error.
- Proceed to set up your Firebase database. Download the required credentials from Firebase and save them as **serviceAccountKey.json**.
- Locate the **initial_database.py** file in the misc directory. Open it and find the designated section to paste your database URL. If your setup and credentials are correct, the script will add the data to the database.
- Once you've created the database, run the **initial_encoding.py** Python file. Ensure that you've placed the image file in the **static/Files/Image** directory and named it with the corresponding user ID from the database. This allows us to associate user images with their unique identification numbers. Additionally, this encoding step will generate a pickle file used for the face recognition model.
- With the previous steps completed, execute the **webapp.py** script. If all the credentials and dependencies are correctly set up, the web application should start running.
